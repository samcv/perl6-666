# NAME

666th module in the Perl 6 Ecosystem is properly Evil!

# SYNOPSIS

```perl6
    use ווו;

    say 2+2; # may or may not have side effects;

    ווו     # call the devil
```

# DESCRIPTION

This module is 666th to make it into the Perl 6's ecosystem. ו is Hebrew
letter Vav, which is the sixth letter, so naturally ווו is 666—
devilish and
bad and stuff (P.S. this is why
[Monster Drink is evil](https://www.google.com/search?q=monster+drink+is+666))

On load, this module will randomly install side effects into common
subroutines. Don't worry, they are not destructive! Devil promises!

If you dislike randomness, you can also call subroutine `ווו` to see those
effects.
